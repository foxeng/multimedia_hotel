- Notify the view about each transaction (especially when paying for a stay
at a hotel) e.g. with a popup.
- When asking for input from the player, use something better than a text field
asking for a hotel id (e.g., a drop-down or radio buttons).
- Reflect on the UI the actions a player can do on each round (disable 'Request
building' and 'Buy entrance' when a player has no property or not enough money).
- Add user help.

- Better separation of concerns of the model / view (possibly add a separate
controller). Better yet, implement the observer pattern.

- Document the code better and more extensively.
