# Multimedia Hotel
Semester project for the multimedia course at ECE NTUA (fall 2018).

A Swing implementation of the [Hotel board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_(board_game)). Requires Java >=9.

The `boards` directory name and path is hardcoded (for now at least). It contains directories (their names are irrelevant)
with the available board configurations. Their format is described in `boards/HOTEL CARD.docx` (in Greek).
